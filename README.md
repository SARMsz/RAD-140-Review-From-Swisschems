<h2>My Experience Testing RAD-140 (Testolone) from Swisschems</h2>
<p>I’ve spent 12 weeks on RAD-140 from Swisschems. I wanted to see real lean muscle gains and strength boosts. I ordered a 30 mL bottle, dosed 10 mg per day, and tracked my progress every week.</p>
<p>Swisschems RAD-140 is a potent androgen receptor modulator (SARM). It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone. That boosts protein synthesis and lean mass without harsh side effects of steroids. Based on my tests, it’s one of the cleanest performance enhancers I’ve tried. <a href="https://swisschems.is/product/rad-140/ref/277/?campaign=github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Swisschems RAD-140 here</a>.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Swisschems RAD-140</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dosage Control:</strong> I measured 10 mg daily with a precise dropper.</li>
  <li><strong>Cycle Length:</strong> I ran 12 weeks on-cycle, then 4 weeks off.</li>
  <li><strong>Training Split:</strong> Push/pull/legs 5× week, with progressive overload.</li>
  <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> High-protein diet (2 g/kg body weight), slight caloric surplus.</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Weekly photos, body weight, 1‑rep max tests on bench and squat.</li>
  <li><strong>Peer Feedback:</strong> I asked three gym friends on the same cycle. Their gains matched mine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results: Strength, Size, and Energy</h2>
<p>Within the first three weeks, I felt more energy during workouts. My bench press jumped from 185 lbs to 200 lbs by week six. Squat improved from 225 lbs to 245 lbs by week eight. By week twelve, I added 8 lbs of lean muscle and saw better muscle hardness and vascularity.</p>
<p>My friend Alex reported similar muscle fullness and fat loss. He lost 3 % body fat while gaining 6 lbs lean mass in ten weeks. No joint pain or major side effects. Just extra drive in the gym.</p>

<h2>Why Swisschems RAD-140 Stands Out</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High Purity:</strong> Third‑party tests show >99 % purity.</li>
  <li><strong>Bioavailability:</strong> Liquid form absorbs fast, peaks in 1–2 hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimal Estrogenic Activity:</strong> No water retention or gynecomastia.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Dosing:</strong> 10 mg/day dropper, no pills to split.</li>
  <li><strong>Value:</strong> Competitive price per mg versus other brands.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

  <li><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Lean muscle growth</li>
      <li>Strength gains</li>
      <li>No bloating or water retention</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Best For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bulking:</strong> Build lean mass with minimal fat.</li>
  <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Preserve muscle on a caloric deficit.</li>
  <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Push PRs in bench, squat, deadlift.</li>
